# Project Title
Siamese Network Classifier for Skin Lesion Images

## Project Description
Siamese network is a neural network that is currently widely used in facial recognition. [1] The network trains by creating pairs, labeling them as similar or dissimilar. Then each image will be processed through convolution layers outputting embedding vectors. Capturing the patterns and the key features of this image. The machine will compare between embedding vectors using distance matrices and determine the contrastive loss. If the images are similar, the loss is small, if different the loss will be large. Through training, the network learns to minimize the contrastive loss with similar pairs and to improve its ability to identify similar and different images effectively. 

This project will be implementing a siamese network aiming to differentiate between benign skin and melanoma skin cancer through learning “The ISIC 2020 Challenge Dataset”. The goal is to achieve an 80% accuracy by classifying skin images either being benign or melanoma.
